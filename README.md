## Description of Dataset:
The dataset, derived from the CDC, describes the sales of liquor, wines, beers, and various supplies from the years 2019 to 2020. The 9 columns provided are: year, month, supplier, item description, item type, retail sales, retail transfers, and warehouse sales. Each sale is quantified by case, with each sale being contextualized by the month in which it was sold.  The data houses 342 unique suppliers as well as 26,822 unique products. 
## Two Questions and Importance:
1) How do retail sales of various alcohols compare from 2019 to 2020? What has the largest and smallest gap? Based on this data, what can we determine the impact of alcohol sales are pre-covid shelter in place versus during covid shelter in place.
   
   Analysing  societal changes in alcohol consumption from 2019 to 2020 provides insights into lifestyle and behavioral changes during the Covid-19 pandemic. Consumer habits drastically shifted during this transition, and by examining the most favorable alcohols during this time can highlight how isolation influenced these habits. 
3) How do retail sales compare to warehouse sales for each year? Can we infer that some alcohol had higher anticipated retail sales than waas actualized? Which alcohols had the highest discrepencies in this area?
   
   Inspecting the differences between retail and warehouse sales during this time can highlight supply shortages, poor demand prediction, and/or overall consumption declines. Through looking at these analyses, we can further understand how businesses adapted during this time. 
## Manipulations Applied to Dataset:
Firstly, we consolidated our data to only include the years 2019 and 2020- the original data set included many years that did not seem relevant to our scope of the project. Then, because the data for the year 2020 only includes months 1-9 (Janurary to September), and the year 2019 includes months 1-11 (Janurary to November), we decided to omit the last two months of the data from 2019 to make the data match more evenly. Additionally, we decicided to omit any rows with a null value in the supplier column to preserve the accuracy of the data. We manipulated the data in Microsoft Excel, filtering each column using the "data" tab in the Excel resources.
