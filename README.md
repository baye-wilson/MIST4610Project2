## Description of Dataset:
The dataset, derived from the CDC, describes the sales of liquor, wines, beers, and various supplies from the years 2019 to 2020. The 9 columns provided are: year, month, supplier, item description, item type, retail sales, retail transfers, and warehouse sales. Each sale is quantified by case, with each sale being contextualized by the month in which it was sold.  The data houses 342 unique suppliers as well as 26,822 unique products. 
## Two Questions and Importance:
1) How do retail sales of various alcohols compare from 2019 to 2020? What has the largest and smallest gap? Based on this data, what can we determine the impact of alcohol sales are pre-covid shelter in place versus during covid shelter in place.
   
   Analysing  societal changes in alcohol consumption from 2019 to 2020 provides insights into lifestyle and behavioral changes during the Covid-19 pandemic. Consumer habits drastically shifted during this transition, and by examining the most favorable alcohols during this time can highlight how isolation influenced these habits. 
3) How do retail sales compare to warehouse sales for each year? Can we infer that some alcohol had higher anticipated retail sales than waas actualized? Which alcohols had the highest discrepencies in this area?
   
   Inspecting the differences between retail and warehouse sales during this time can highlight supply shortages, poor demand prediction, and/or overall consumption declines. Through looking at these analyses, we can further understand how businesses adapted during this time. 
## Manipulations Applied to Dataset:
Firstly, we consolidated our data to only include the years 2019 and 2020- the original data set included many years that did not seem relevant to our scope of the project. Then, because the data for the year 2020 only includes months 1-9 (Janurary to September), and the year 2019 includes months 1-11 (Janurary to November), we decided to omit the last two months of the data from 2019 to make the data match more evenly. Additionally, we decicided to omit any rows with a null value in the supplier column to preserve the accuracy of the data. We manipulated the data in Microsoft Excel, filtering each column using the "data" tab in the Excel resources.

To understand how retail performance shifted year-to-year, we aggregated retail sales by item type (Liquor, Wine, Beer, and Kegs) for both 2019 and 2020 and visualized them side-by-side. This bar chart clearly illustrates that every category saw lower total sales in 2020, with liquor and wine experiencing the largest declines. The code for this analysis filtered the data by both year and item type, then summed retail sales within each grouping to create a clean comparison across periods.
One key observation is that 2019 contains significantly more robust data, which likely reflects a full year of normal retail activity before COVID-19 disruptions occurred. In contrast, the decreased totals in 2020 may be influenced by more than just reduced customer demand- many retailers in this dataset include bars, restaurants, and other on-premise establishments, which experienced prolonged shutdowns, limited capacity, and reduced hours. These operational constraints, combined with possible gaps in reporting or fewer transactions, contribute to the noticeable drop across all product categories.
This comparison is meaningful for analysts, distributors, and inventory planners because it highlights how external events can shift consumer consumption patterns and affect product movement across the alcohol industry. The chart not only shows a decline in sales but also underscores the sensitivity of certain retail segments to macro-level disruptions, offering context for demand forecasting and operational decision-making.

To visualize trends over time, we aggregated retail and warehouse sales by month and constructed a continuous timeline from January 2019 through late 2020. By converting each (YEAR, MONTH) pair into a single DATE_FROM_PARTS field, we created a clean, chronological x-axis that avoids combining months across multiple years. This allowed us to clearly compare distribution-level sales activity (warehouse) with direct consumer-level sales (retail).
The results show strong, uninterrupted data reporting throughout 2019, with both retail and warehouse sales following predictable seasonal patterns. However, beginning in 2020, we observe noticeable gaps and irregularities— certain months display incomplete or significantly lower totals. These anomalies align with the height of COVID-19’s operational disruptions, suggesting potential shutdowns, staffing shortages, or delays in data entry, rather than a true collapse in sales volume. The contrast between robust 2019 data and fragmented 2020 data provides an example of how external events can impact data availability and reliability.
Across the full timeline, warehouse sales consistently exceed retail sales, reinforcing the scale difference between supply-chain distribution and point-of-sale activity. This visualization is meaningful for supply chain teams, inventory planners, and analysts because it highlights both demand patterns and data integrity challenges, offering a clearer understanding of how real-world events shape both operations and reporting.

To better understand product-level performance, we wrote a query that filters the dataset by item description, isolating all beer-related items and grouping them by brand. By aggregating total retail sales for each product, we were able to rank brands based on overall demand and identify the top performers. This analysis revealed that Corona Extra Loose Top was the highest-selling beer product in the dataset, making it a clear standout in consumer preference.
We represented this insight in a scorecard visualization, allowing users to instantly see the top performer and its total retail sales value. Additionally, we created a ranked list of the top 5 beer performers, giving sales analysts, category managers, and inventory planners a quick snapshot of high-impact products. This ranking helps guide purchasing decisions, promotional strategies, and inventory optimization across retail and warehouse operations.
